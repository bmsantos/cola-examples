# kotlin-dependson-tests

Language: Kotlin

Setup: maven + cola-maven-plugin

Focus: COLA Test @DependsOn annotation


Other technologies: Spark Framework, Sql2o, jCommander, H2, Fuel and AssertJ

 This example is a Kotlin implementation of a Spark Framework tutorial by [Federico Tomasseti](https://sparktutorials.github.io/2015/09/27/spark-testing-functional.html). In addition, COLA Tests were used to replace Cucumber.

 The example is used to demonstrate the [@DependsOn](https://github.com/bmsantos/cola-tests/wiki/Documentation#depending-on-external-tests) annotation which provides a simple way of reusing external COLA Tests or jUnit Tests in other COLA Tests.

See [COLA Tests wiki](https://github.com/bmsantos/cola-tests/wiki) for more information.
Refer to [@Depends](https://github.com/bmsantos/cola-tests/wiki/Documentation#depending-on-external-tests) documentation for further details.
